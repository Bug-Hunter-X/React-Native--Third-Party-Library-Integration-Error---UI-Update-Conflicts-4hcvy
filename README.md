# React Native Third-Party Library Integration Error

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when integrating third-party libraries into React Native applications. The issue arises from attempts to directly manipulate the UI outside of React Native's rendering cycle, leading to unexpected behavior and crashes.

## Problem
The `bug.js` file showcases a scenario where a hypothetical third-party library (`ThirdPartyLibrary`) tries to update the UI using methods incompatible with React Native (e.g., directly manipulating the DOM). This results in errors and inconsistencies.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected implementation. It utilizes React Native's state management and lifecycle methods to ensure seamless integration with the third-party library.  The library is wrapped in a `useEffect` hook to control the update timing and prevent conflicts.

## Setup
1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies (if any).
4. Run `npx react-native run-android` or `npx react-native run-ios` to run the app on your device or emulator.

## Note
This example uses a hypothetical third-party library.  Replace it with your actual library to replicate and solve the specific issue in your project.
